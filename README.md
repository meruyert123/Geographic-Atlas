# Geographic-Atlas

## Description

This is an iOS test assignment for the STRONG TEAM Summer Internship. The goal is to develop a Geographic Atlas iPhone application that allows users to learn more about world countries, browse a list of countries grouped by parts of the world, and view detailed information about any country.

## Application usage
You can go through scrollable list of all the world countries grouped by parts of the world.

Each element in the list able to switch between expanded/collapsed states when the user taps on the element.

By tapping the “Learn more” button in the expanded element state, screen will provide the detailed information of the currently selected country. 

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
• As an iOS project, it needs to be built on a computer running macOS, preferably [macOS 11.6, a.k.a. “Big Sur”](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-big-sur/id1526878132?mt=12) or later.
• The project is built using Apple’s official IDE Xcode, which is available for download via the macOS [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
• You’ll need an iOS device, either real or virtual:
○ If you want to deploy the app to a real iOS device, you’ll need a free [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/programs/), which requires an [Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/apple-id) with [two-factor authentication](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915) enabled.
○ If you want to deploy the app to a virtual iOS device, you just need Xcode, which includes the Simulator (which simulates current iOS devices and operating systems), as well as a facility for downloading simulators for older iOS devices and operating systems.

## Installing and running the app
To install and run the app, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/meruyert123/Battle.git
```
2. Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking the .xcodeproj file.
3. Select a simulator or a connected device from the Xcode toolbar.
4. Click the "Run" button (or press Cmd+R) to build and run the app on the selected device.

5. The app should now launch on the simulator or connected device you selected.

## Architecture

## Structure

## Advanced
1. Use SwiftUI only
2. Use “skeleton views” for all the elements while API requests are performed
3. Make the expand/collapse feature for CountriesList animated, with no UI bugs
4. Add the images caching and reuse them from cache
5. Use “nice” naming
6. Write safe code, leave no possibility of crashes
7. Make the “Capital coordinates” latitude + longitude value on the CountryDetails screen tappable;




Great job!
